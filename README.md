This repo contains my project for Data Engineer Course - CoderHouse. 
The project it's 100% to learn. 

The APi selected is: 

<b> Asteroids - NeoWs</b>
NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) is a RESTful web service for near earth Asteroid information. With NeoWs a user can: search for Asteroids based on their closest approach date to Earth, lookup a specific Asteroid with its NASA JPL small body id, as well as browse the overall data-set.
